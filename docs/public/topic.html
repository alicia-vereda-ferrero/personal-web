        <h1>My Vinyl Collection</h1>
        
        <p>
            I've always liked music, but collecting vinyls is different. It's not just about hitting play on Spotify, it's about having the actual record, and the whole vibe of putting it on the turntable.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            It's actually pretty simple,altought everyone says it looks unreal. If you look closely, a record has one long spiral line called a groove. The music is literally "carved" into that line. When the record spins, the needle (stylus) follows those bumps and vibrates.

        <h2>From a needle to the speakers</h2>
        <p>
            Those tiny vibrations go from the needle to a small part called the cartridge, which turns the movement into electricity. Since that signal is super weak, it goes through an amplifier so the speakers can finally play the sound.

        <p>
            It's a bit old-school, but that's exactly why I like it. It feels more real and sounds warmer than digital files.

## Description
This project consists of the design and development of a personal website.

The website is divided into several sections:
* **Home:** A personal introduction and professional profile.
* **About:** About me, my curriculum in pdf and links to my social media.
* **Degree:** An overview of my Computer Engineering degree at UFV, including a detailed course table.
* **FCE Subject:** Summary of the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering course.
* **Net:** A networking page with 4 links to my classmates websites.
* **Topic:** A personal research page about **Vinyl Records**, explaining a little bit about it from a collector's perspective.
* **Contact:** A simple contact form. 


## Problems
During the development of this website, I faced several problems:

1.  **CSS Specificity & Layout:** One of the main issues was the title (`h1`) alignment. Applying a general margin to all titles brokee the layout of the Home and Contact pages. I solved this by using **specific CSS selectors** to target only the pages that needed extra spacing due to the fixed header.
2.  **Fixed Navigation Bar:** Creating a fixed header meant that content would sometimes hide behind it. I fixed this by implementing a consistent `margin-top` across all main containers.

## Conclusions
Working on this project has been a great way to understand how the web works behind the scenes.
Overall, this practical work has provided me with a solid foundation in web development and a professional tool to showcase my progress in the degree.
